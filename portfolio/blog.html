            <h3>How to get out of an art-block?</h3>

                    <p>Picture this, you're a creative person, typically you would want to make some art, right? Maybe draw a picture or paint something, but you find yourself just sitting there in front of an empty piece of paper, starring at the wall. It pains you to see nothing comes out, and if magically something does, it's not satisfying at all and you feel yourself losing all motivation. If you're in this situation, you might have gotten stuck in an art-block. This is very common amongst artists and creative people. More common than you'd think. SO, I've got some few tips and tricks to try and get more inspiration and motivation.

                    1. When feeling stuck in your art process, try and go outside. Look at nature and get a breath of fresh air. Many known artists have been most inspired through nature. Plus, it's healthy! 
                
                
                    2. Get together with your creative friends and make an art-date. You can get more motivated when doing things together. Two heads work better than one. 
                
                        
                    3. Find an inspiration source: Maybe you use sites like Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest or if you've been here long enough, DeviantART is your good old friend! I find Pinterest being a good source for finding Ex. practicing drawing body poses, portraits, hands, backgrounds etc. Whatever you want to work on or get better at, you can find it on platforms like this. But maybe your inspiration comes from other things like music artists or something totally different, whatever makes you happy, can give some more motivation to get through with an idea.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>4. Don't be too hard on yourself. You can start small. Just get a tiny bit done and don't worry if it's not perfect. Drawing should be fun and at the end of the day, you're making art because you love it and it's your passion. Everyone has off-days and taking it bit by bit is a better way to work your inspiration up, as long as you just get drawing. 
                
                    5. Focus points: as mentioned earlier, you can focus on certain things you want to improve on. Let's say you have a hard time drawing hands (I see a lot of artists nodding here, hehe). You can try out tutorials, find reference photos from every angle or even use yourself for reference. If it's portraits, using a mirror for drawing yourself could be an opportunity. If you want to practice life drawing, you could draw your friends and switch around every 5, 10 or 15 minutes which is also kind of a challenge, testing your ability in a short-to-long time span. If looking at people in person isn't your cup of tea, you can always look up references of life drawing models. The options are endless! Hopefully some of these tips and tricks will come in handy for you. Let's get creating!</p>
